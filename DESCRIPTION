Description: The `twfeweights` package computes implicit weights on group-time average treatment effects (these are disaggregated causal effect parameters) when researchers estimate a two-way fixed effects (TWFE) regression.  These weights are useful for understanding how a regression implicitly combines underlying building blocks into a single number.  In settings where the TWFE regression additionally includes covariates, the `twfeweights` package can be useful for researchers for assessing how well implicit weight balance (functions of) the covariates across groups and time periods.
